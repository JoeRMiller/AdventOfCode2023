### Part 1
#### Initial thoughts
Looks like we are building an upside down fibonacci? tree. Create a list of list from the input, work backward from each to calculate the extrapolated number.
Sum the extrapolated numbers

### Implementation
Read input into List of List of ints
For each list, calculate the extrapolated value =>

	First, expand the list into a tree iteravely.
	Then go backwards through the list appending the extrapolated value to each list.
	Finally, return the last item in the first list.
